## Quick setup
1. Setup your Schwab developer account [here](https://beta-developer.schwab.com/).
   - Create a new Schwab individual developer app with callback url "https://127.0.0.1"
   - Add **both** API products to the app: "Accounts and Trading Production" and "Market Data Production".  
   - Wait until the app status is "Ready for use", note that "Approved - Pending" will not work.
   - Enable TOS (Thinkorswim) for your Schwab account, it is needed for orders and other api calls.
2. Install packages
   - Install schwabdev `pip install schwabdev`
   - *You may need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`*
3. Examples on how to use the client are in the `examples/` folder (add your keys in the .env file)  
   - The first time you run you will have to sign in to your Schwab account using the generated link in the terminal. 
   - After signing in, agree to the terms, and select account(s). Then you will have to copy the link in the address bar and paste it into the terminal. 
   - Questions? - join the [Discord group](https://discord.gg/m7SSjr9rs9) or consult the `/docs` folder.  
```py
import schwabdev #import the package

client = schwabdev.Client('Your app key', 'Your app secret')  #create a client

print(client.account_linked().json()) #make api calls
```

## What can this program do?
 - Authenticate and access the full api. 
 - Automatic token management and "access token" refreshes.
 - Functions for all api functions (examples in `examples/api_demo.py`)
 - Stream real-time data with a customizable response handler (examples in `examples/stream_demo.py`)
 - Place orders and get order details (examples in `examples/orders_demo.py`)
 - Option for capture of callback urls when callback has a port (starts webserver on this port).
 - Option for automatic starting/stopping of streamer when market opens/closes.
 - Streaming stability with automatic restarts if the streamer crashes.

### Notes
The schwabdev folder contains code for main operations:   
 - `__init__.py` linker to client class.
 - `client.py` contains functions relating to api calls and requests.
 - `tokens.py` contains functions relating to token management.
 - `stream.py` contains functions for streaming data from websockets.
