Using the Client
================

| The client is used to make api calls and start streaming data from the
  Schwab API.
| In order to use all api calls you must have both “APIs” added to your
  app, both “Accounts and Trading Production” and “Market Data
  Production”

It is recommended to store your app keys and app secret in a dot-env
file ``.env`` especially if you are using a git repo. With a github repo
you can include ``*.env`` and ``tokens.json`` in the ``.gitignore`` file
to stop your credentials from getting commited.

Making a client is as simple as:

.. code:: python

   import schwabdev

   client = schwabdev.Client(app_key, app_secret)

| And from here on “client” can be used to make api calls via
  ``client.XXXX()``, all calls are outlined in ``examples/api_demo.py``
  and ``docs/api.md``.
| Now lets look at all of the parameters that can be passed to the
  client constructor:
..

    | ``client = schwabdev.Client(app_key, app_secret, callback_url="https://127.0.0.1", tokens_file="tokens.json", timeout=5, verbose=True, update_tokens_auto=True)``
    | * app_key(str): app key to use, 32 chars long.
    | * app_secret(str): app secret to use, 16 chars long.
    | * callback_url(str): callback url to use, must be https and not end with a slash “/”.
    | * tokens_file(str): path to tokens file.
    | * timeout(int): timeout to use when making requests.
    | * verbose(bool): verbose (print extra information that isn’t necessary).

Schwabdev now uses the logging module to log/print information, warnings
and errors. You can change the level of logging by setting
``logging.basicConfig(level=logging.XXXX)`` where ``XXXX`` is the level
of logging you want such as ``INFO`` or ``WARNING``.

Schwabdev can also capture the callback urls, so you dont have to
copy/paste. If you use a callback url such as ``https://127.0.0.1:7777``
then Schwabdev will listen on port 7777 and capture the callback url
after you have signed in your account. You may get a warning
“net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID” since it is a self-signed certificate
but this is not an issue, just click “Advanced” -> “Proceed to …” to
send the code to Schwabdev (usually only warns the first time). If you
still want to copy/paste then remove the port from your callback url.

The Schwab API uses two tokens to use the api: \* Refresh token - valid
for 7 days, used to “refresh” the access token. \* Access token - valid
for 30 minutes, used in all api calls.

| If you want to access the access or refresh tokens you can call
  ``client.tokens.access_token`` or ``client.tokens.refresh_token``.
| The access token can be easily updated/refreshed assuming that the
  refresh token is valid, getting a new refresh token, however, requires
  user input. It is recommended force-update the refresh token during
  weekends so it is valid during the week, this can be done with the
  call: ``client.tokens.update_tokens(force=True)``, or by changing the
  date in ``tokens.json``.

If you want to manually control token updating then you can set
``update_tokens_auto=False`` during client creation and have your own
thread that updates the tokens. Look at the
``client.tokens.update_tokens(...)`` method (in tokens.py). Essentially
you want to keep the access token and refresh tokens valid, you can
probably use ``client.tokens.update_access_token`` directly and make
your own ``client.tokens.update_refresh_token`` function. Keep in mind
that Schwabdev can also listen on a port and capture the callback url,
you could use a different port for the callback and let Schwabdev listen
on it.

Common Issues
-------------

   | **Problem**: unauthorized error
     ``{'errors': [{'id': 'XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX', 'status': 401, 'title': 'Unauthorized', 'detail': 'Client not authorized'}]}``
   | **Cause**: You do not have access to both APIs and are attempting to
     access one that you have not added to your app.
   | **Fix**: Add both APIs “Accounts and Trading Production” and “Market
     Data Production” to your app.
   | **Cause**: The access token is expired, sometimes Schwab invalidates
     tokens when they make backend changes.
   | **Fix**: Manually update access token by changing the date in
     ``tokens.json`` or update both tokens by calling
     ``client.tokens.update_tokens(force=True)``

..

   | **Problem**: Trying to sign into account and get error message: “We are
     unable to complete your request. Please contact customer service
     for further assistance.”
   | **Problem**: “Whitelabel Error Page This application has no configured
     error view, so you are seeing this as a fallback.” (status=500)
   | **Fix**: Your app is “Approved - Pending”, you must wait for status
     “Ready for Use”.
   | Note: Or you *could* have an account type that is not supported by
     the Schwab API.

..

   | **Problem**: SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED - self-signed certificate
     in certificate chain error when connecting to streaming server
   | **Fix**: For MacOS you must run the python certificates installer:
     ``open /Applications/Python\ 3.12/Install\ Certificates.command``

..

   | **Problem**: Issues with option contracts in api calls or streaming:
   | **Fix**: You are likely not following the format for option contracts.
   | Option contract format: Symbol (6 characters including spaces!) \|
     Expiration (6 characters) \| Call/Put (1 character) \| Strike Price
     (5+3=8 characters)

..

   | **Problem**:
     “{”error”:“unsupported_token_type”,“error_description”:“400 Bad
     Request: "{"error_description":"Exception while authenticating
     refresh token…”
   | **Problem**: “Could not get new access token (1 of 3).” (or x of 3 etc)
   | **Cause**: Your refresh token is invalid (maybe you created a new
     refresh token on a different machine).
   | **Fix**: Manually update refresh token by changing the date in
     ``tokens.json`` or by calling
     ``client.tokens.update_tokens(force=True)``

..

   | **Problem**: “can’t register atexit after shutdown”
   | **Cause**: The main thread dies before the stream thread starts
   | **Fix**: Add a delay after starting or sending a request, something to
     let the stream thread start up before the main thread closes.

..

   | **Problem**: API calls throwing errors despite access token and refresh
     token being valid / not expired.
   | **Fix**: Manually update refresh / access tokens by calling
     ``client.tokens.update_tokens(force=True)``; You can also delete
     the tokens.json file.

..

   | **Problem**: Streaming ACCT_ACTIVITY yields no responses.
   | **Fix**: This is a known issue on Schwab’s end.

..

   | **Problem**: After signing in, you get a “Access Denied” web page.
   | **Fix**: Your callback url is likely incorrect due to a slash “/” at
     the end.

..

   | **Problem**: App Registration Error
   | **Fix**: email Schwab (traderapi@schwab.com)

..

   | **Problem**: Issue in streaming with websockets - “Unsupported
     extension: name = permessage-deflate, params = []”
   | **Cause**: You are using a proxy that is blocking streaming or your DNS
     is not correctly resolving.
   | **Fix**: Change DNS servers (Google’s are known-working) or
     change/bypass proxy.

..

   | **Problem**: “{‘fault’: {‘faultstring’: ‘Body buffer overflow’,
     ‘detail’: {‘errorcode’: ‘protocol.http.TooBigBody’}}}”
   | **Cause**: The call that you made exceeds the amount of data that can
     be returned.
   | Example: The call ``print(client.option_chains("$SPX").json())``
     returns too much data and will exceed the buffer size.
   | **Fix**: Add additional parameters to limit the amount of data
     returned.

..

   **Problem**: refresh token expiring in 7 days is too short. - No fix, this cannot be changed.
